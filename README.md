<h3 align="center">Analysis of products using NLP</h3>
</div>


## Project Description
>A platform(website) where you can enter a product's description to check if similar products exist in the market already. If they do, then you can get all the information about the products, the similarities between the products and how it was accepted by the consumers. If the consumers had mixed reviews, then you can filter out the positive/negative reviews according to your need to understand the consumer market of that product.  Different NLP methods can be used for getting deeper understanding of Consumers.
This can be used to determine if one should go forward into making that product, or what are the specific thing that has been done by its competitors that brought them a great success as compared to the ones who failed.
This will help greatly to new upcoming business ideas who want to study the consumers reaction to certain products, and who want to see if their idea already exists in the market.
It can further help existing products to check out their competition and get insights about their project.
The clients will be able to see the visualization of the insights found from the data.
As of now, the dataset for different product reviews will be taken from Kaggle.
